|      For optimal performance we recommend to set                            |
|        NCORE= 4 - approx SQRT( number of cores)                             |
|      NCORE specifies how many cores store one orbital (NPAR=cpu/NCORE).     |
|      This setting can  greatly improve the performance of VASP for DFT.     |
|      The default, NPAR=number of cores might be grossly inefficient         |
|      on modern multi-core architectures or massively parallel machines.     |
|      Do your own testing !!!!                                               |
|      Unfortunately you need to use the default for GW and RPA calculations. |
|      (for HF NCORE is supported but not extensively tested yet)             |
